HighlightAssist Bridge Installed ✨
───────────────────────────────────

What just happened
• HighlightAssist Bridge scripts, service manager, and native messaging host were copied to %APPDATA%\HighlightAssist.
• Optional items (desktop shortcut, auto-start) were created based on your selections.
• Chrome/Edge native messaging manifests were registered so the extension can securely start/stop the bridge.

Next steps
1. Launch the “HighlightAssist Bridge” shortcut (or let the browser extension start it automatically).
2. Open Chrome/Edge, enable the HighlightAssist extension, and use the Bridge tab to verify the daemon connection.
3. Review the README inside the install directory for troubleshooting and advanced usage.

Support & Safety
• Docs, issue tracker, and updates: https://github.com/Skullcandyxxx/HighlightAssist
• Logs: %LOCALAPPDATA%\HighlightAssist\logs (safe to share when reporting bugs).
• To uninstall, use “Apps & Features” or run this installer again and choose “Uninstall”.

Thank you for building better UI experiences with HighlightAssist!
