**Title:** I built a lightweight alternative to DevTools for quick element inspection (80% faster!)

**Body:**

Hey r/webdev! 👋

I just open-sourced **HighlightAssist** - a browser extension I built to solve a problem that's been bugging me for months.

## The Problem

Every time I need to check a simple element property during development (tag name, class, ID, etc.), I have to:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Navigate the DOM tree
3. Find my element among hundreds
4. Read the info
5. Close DevTools

For 10 quick checks, this takes **50-70 seconds**. That's a lot of context switching and cognitive overhead for something so simple.

## The Solution

**HighlightAssist** gives you instant element info with ONE CLICK:
- Click element → See tooltip → Done
- Same 10 checks take **~10 seconds**
- 80% time savings!

## Key Features

⚡ **Lightning Fast** - No DOM navigation, instant tooltips
⌨️ **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Ctrl+Shift+H to toggle
🎯 **Vite Auto-Detection** - Finds your dev server automatically (ports 5173, 3000, 3001, 5174)
🔒 **Privacy First** - Localhost only, zero data collection
💎 **Beautiful UI** - Modern gradient design with badge indicator
🎮 **Opera GX Compatible** - Works on Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera GX

## Why Not Just Use DevTools?

DevTools are amazing for deep debugging, but overkill for quick checks. Think of it like opening Photoshop to crop an image vs. using your OS's screenshot tool. Both work, but one is way faster for simple tasks.

I wrote up a full comparison here: https://github.com/Skullcandyxxx/HighlightAssist/blob/master/WHY_NOT_DEVTOOLS.md

## Tech Stack

- Manifest V3
- Vanilla JavaScript (no framework overhead)
- Chrome Extension APIs
- Works with any Vite project (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)

## Try It Out

## 📝 Reddit Post - r/vite

**Title:** [Tool] Built an element inspector specifically for Vite development - 80% faster than DevTools for quick checks

**Body:**

Hey Vite community! 👋

I've been working with Vite for over a year now (mostly React and Vue projects), and I kept running into the same frustration: opening DevTools just to check simple element properties felt like overkill.

So I built **HighlightAssist** - a browser extension that makes element inspection instant.

## What It Does

- Click any element on your localhost to see its tag, classes, ID, and positioning
- Toggle with Ctrl+Shift+H keyboard shortcut
- Auto-detects Vite servers on ports 5173, 3000, 3001, 5174
- Inline tooltips (no screen real estate lost to DevTools panels)
- Badge indicator shows when it's active

## Why I Built This

**DevTools workflow for 10 quick element checks:** ~50-70 seconds
- Right-click, Inspect, Navigate DOM, Find element, Read, Close
- Context switching breaks flow state

**HighlightAssist workflow:** ~10 seconds
- Click element, Read tooltip, Keep coding
- Stay in development flow

**80% time savings** on routine inspection tasks!

## Perfect For

- Checking if CSS classes are applied correctly
- Verifying component rendering
- Quick debugging during active development
- Anyone who wants to stay in flow without DevTools overhead

## Privacy & Security

- Localhost only (127.0.0.1, localhost, *.local)
- Zero data collection
- No external network requests
- Fully open source and auditable

## Try It Out

**GitHub:** https://github.com/Skullcandyxxx/HighlightAssist

Currently available for Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Opera GX (manual install). Store submissions pending.

I wrote this specifically for the Vite community since I couldn't find anything else that auto-detects Vite servers and works exclusively on localhost.

Would love your feedback! ⭐

## 📝 Reddit Post - r/reactjs

**Title:** Built a browser extension for quick element inspection during React development (no DevTools needed!)

**Body:**

Hey React devs! 👋

I just open-sourced a tool that's been saving me hours every week while building React apps with Vite.

## The Problem

When building React components, I constantly need to check:
- "Did that className prop actually apply?"
- "What's the ID of this form element?"
- "Is this positioned correctly?"

Opening DevTools for each check takes **5-7 seconds**. Multiply that by dozens of checks per day, and it adds up.

## The Solution: HighlightAssist

A lightweight browser extension that gives you instant element info with one click:

⚡ Click element → See tag/class/id/position → Done
⌨️ Ctrl+Shift+H to toggle on/off
🎯 Auto-detects Vite dev servers
💎 Beautiful gradient UI
🔒 Privacy-first (localhost only)

## Real-World Example

**Checking 10 elements:**
- DevTools: 50-70 seconds (right-click, inspect, navigate, find, read, close x10)
- HighlightAssist: ~10 seconds (click, read x10)

**80% faster!**

## Use Cases

Perfect for when you're:
- Debugging CSS modules or styled-components
- Verifying Tailwind classes are applied
- Checking component ref IDs
- Inspecting portal/modal positioning
- Quick checks during rapid prototyping

## Tech Details

- Manifest V3 extension
- Works with any Vite + React setup
- Compatible with Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera GX
- Open source (MIT License)

## Why Not DevTools?

DevTools are incredible for deep debugging, but overkill for "what class is this?" questions. This is the quick, lightweight alternative for staying in flow.

## Get It

**GitHub:** https://github.com/Skullcandyxxx/HighlightAssist

Manual install for now (Chrome/Opera/Firefox store submissions pending).

# I Built a Lightweight DevTools Alternative for Vite Developers (80% Faster for Quick Checks)

After months of opening DevTools just to check simple element properties during Vite development, I finally snapped and built a solution: **HighlightAssist**.

## The Frustration

Picture this: You're building a React component with Vite. You need to verify that a CSS class was applied. What do you do?

**The typical workflow:**
1. Right-click element → Inspect
2. Wait for DevTools to load
3. Navigate through the DOM tree
4. Find your element among hundreds
5. Read the class name
6. Close DevTools
7. Resume coding

**Time:** 5-7 seconds per check

Do this 10 times in a row (which is totally normal during active development), and you've spent **50-70 seconds** just context-switching.

## The Solution

What if you could click an element and instantly see its properties? No DevTools. No context switching. No cognitive overhead.

That's **HighlightAssist**:

```javascript
// Workflow
click element → read tooltip → keep coding
// Time: ~1 second per check
```

**For 10 quick checks:**
- DevTools: 50-70 seconds
- HighlightAssist: ~10 seconds

**80% time savings.** 🚀

## How It Works

HighlightAssist is a browser extension that:

1. **Auto-detects your Vite server** (ports 5173, 3000, 3001, 5174)
2. **Injects a lightweight inspector** into your localhost page
3. **Shows inline tooltips** when you click elements
4. **Displays tag, classes, ID, and positioning** instantly

### Key Features

⚡ **Lightning Fast** - One click, instant info
⌨️ **Keyboard Shortcuts** - `Ctrl+Shift+H` to toggle
🎯 **Vite-Specific** - Auto-detection, zero config
🔒 **Privacy First** - Localhost only, no data collection
💎 **Beautiful UI** - Modern gradients, smooth animations
🎮 **Wide Compatibility** - Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera GX

## Code Example

The injected script dynamically imports your Vite module:

```javascript
// Simplified version of injected.js
async function loadHighlightTool() {
  const ports = [5173, 3000, 3001, 5174];
  
  for (const port of ports) {
    try {
      const module = await import(`http://localhost:${port}/@vite/client`);
      // Module loaded successfully, Vite server found!
      await import(`http://localhost:${port}/src/highlight/highlight-tool.js`);
      console.log('✅ HighlightAssist loaded');
      break;
    } catch (error) {
      continue; // Try next port
    }
  }
}
```

Clean, simple, effective.

## Why Not Just Use DevTools?

**DevTools are amazing** for:
- Deep debugging
- Network analysis  
- Performance profiling
- Complex CSS debugging

**But they're overkill for:**
- "What class is this?" ❓
- "Did my prop apply?" ❓
- "What's this element's ID?" ❓

Think of it like using Photoshop to crop an image vs. your OS's screenshot tool. Both work, but one is **way faster** for simple tasks.

## Real-World Impact

Since I started using HighlightAssist:

- ✅ Less context switching during development
- ✅ Longer periods in flow state
- ✅ Faster iteration on UI components
- ✅ Less mental fatigue from constant DevTools usage

It doesn't replace DevTools. It **complements** them for 80% of daily checks.

## Tech Stack

- **Manifest V3** - Modern extension standard
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No framework overhead
- **Chrome Extension APIs** - storage, scripting, commands
- **Modern CSS** - Gradients, backdrop-filter, animations
